# Communicating with server

- How to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen.

- How to submit data to a React application using HTML forms.

- How JS code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote
  backend server.

- How to add CSS styles to our React applications.

## a. Rendering a collection, modules

#### console.log

- When something does not work, log or use some other way of debugging.

```javascript
console.log('props value is', props);
```

#### JS arrays

React using functional programming methods of JS array, such as `find`,
`filter`, and `map`.

#### Rendering collections

Instead of render _objects in an array_ by referring to a hard-coded index
number

```javascript
<li> {note[1].content}</li>
```

A more approriate to generate React-elements from the array objects is using the
`map` function.

```javascript
notes.map(note => <li> {note.content}</li>);
```

#### Key-attribute

Each items in a list, i.e. the element generated by the `map` method, must have
a unique key value.

```javascript
{
	notes.map(note => <li key={note.id}>{note.content}</li>);
}
```

React uses the `key` attributes of objects in an array to determine how to
update the view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered.

#### Map

`Map` creates a new array, the elements of which have been created from the
elements of the original array by mapping, using the function given as a
parameter to the map method.

#### Anty-pattern: array indexes as keys

In the case where the unique key value is unavailable, we can use the array
indexes as key. The indexes can be retrieved by passing a second parameter to
the map method

```javascript
notes.map((note, i) => <li key={i}> {note.content}</li>);
```

When call like this, `i` is assigned the value of the index of the position in
the array where the Note resides.

This tricks is **unsafe** because React uses `key` attribute as a way to
identify DOM element. When a new element push to the list or remove a section of
an array, the key is remain in the same order but the component is not.

We can use array indexes as keys when

- the list and items are static
- the items in the list have no ids
- the list is never reordered or filtered

#### Reduce

The `reduce()` method executes a **reducer** function on each element of the
array, resulting in a single output value.
